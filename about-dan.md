#### Scouter

I have been Scouting for 23 years and then some. I have been in and out of the programs, as a participant and a leader, but I have never quit being a Scout. I'm a proud Eagle Scout, [I used to be an Eagle](http://www.woodbadge.org/), and am currently the Troop/Team/Crew Committee Chairman for our local unit.

#### Mormon

I owe my involvement in scouting to my being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is the [largest sponsoring organization of the BSA](http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/operating_orgs/Latter-day_Saints.aspx), and was the first sponsoring organization of BSA. As the name of my faith states, I am a follower of Jesus Christ, and I believe that the ideals of Scouting closely match those of my faith.

#### Husband and Father

I am married to the most wonderful woman ever and am the father of 5 children, including one new Cub Scout. If there's anything my kids have loved, it has been going with Dad to Scouts. I owe every moment I get to volunteer as a leader in Scouts today to my family and their support.
