## What is this site?

A blogger I follow talks about the **Magic of 7**, namely that

>"it takes hearing new information 7 times before itâ€™s retained." 

In other words, what is found on this site is not necessarily new. In fact, this may be the _umpteenth_ time hearing what you've read. However, **it is the aim of the site to "do a good turn daily"** and to **"help other people at all times."**

If what you've found here is helpful, please feel free to pass it on.
