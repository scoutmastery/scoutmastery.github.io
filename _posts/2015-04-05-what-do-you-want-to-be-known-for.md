Many men have done many great things. However, more often than not, selective memory and the history books publish relatively more than _one_ notable act from that man's life.

###Benjamin Franklin
* Invented bifocals
* Printer
* Helped to start Philadelphia's Fire Department
* First US Ambassador to France
* **Known for:** Flying a kite in a lightning storm.

###Albert Einstein
* Instrumental in the U.S. developing Atomic Bombs
* Passionate member of _NAACP_ & anti-racism
* Developed a refrigerator
* Critical of capitalism, in favor of socialism
* **Known for:** _E=mc^2_

###Abraham Lincoln
* Talented wrestler in his youth
* Married into a slave-owning family
* Self-taught lawyer
* **Known for:** Gettysburg Address (_"Four score and seven years ago..."_)

###Dave Thomas
* Worked with Col. Sanders and responsible for much of KFC's successful innovations
* Freemason
* Enlisted in the Army
* Highschool dropout
* **Known for:** Wendy's restaurants

Each of these individuals could have stopped at any one of these points, and perhaps they would have wished to be known for one more than another.

You have your whole life ahead of you...
