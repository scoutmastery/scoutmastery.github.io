In the world today we can see and experience conflict everywhere -- people fighting one with another, or warring within themselves with the way they _are_ toward others. For those who cannot find peace on their own there are those who seek to help; mediators to go between the parties at war.

When faced with this reality, what is needed most instead of mediation is meditation. Everyone has the power and ability to:

**STOP**


**_listen_**


**_feel_**


**_breathe_**

Through this introspection, one can make peace within their core & mind and in turn be peaceful to all they meet.

A favorite hymn of mine is "[Take time to be holy](http://alloverthepiano.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Take-time-to-be-Holy-Revised.pdf)."

A Scout is reverent, kind and cheerful.

Make time to meditate and you'll more easily live these points of the Scout Law.
