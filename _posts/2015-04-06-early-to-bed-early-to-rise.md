The forest where Proudfoot and Dawntreader lived was a beautiful glen, rich with the bounty the earth could provide. Each morning, while the moon still shone, Dawntreader would leave the bed in search of wild strawberries and lush grass. The young saplings, saturated from a long night’s drink from the springs deep under ground, were supple and their rich bark gave Dawntreader many of the things a young buck needed to grow strong before winter. Most of all, Dawntreader went in search of the Dawn Bud, which grew by the cool dew pools, and only opened just before the light of dawn, yielding up their sweet, supple petals to the diligent seeker. 

Though Dawntreader knew all of these treasures of the glen well, Proudfoot thought they were either mere story or not worth the early morning arousal. For Proudfoot believed that a young buck needed rest, so that (when the paring time came) he would never be found tired and weak. Putting full stock in his way of life, Proudfoot lay in his bed until the warmth of the sun signaled a new day. Dawntreader had often invited Proudfoot to join him by the moonlight, and to come enjoy the delicious water of the dew pools and to feast on the dawn bud. However, Proudfoot shook his growing crown of antlers in protest. “You weaken yourself, rising so early. When the time comes, I will be glad I saved my strength for the pairing, not searching for a mere flower.” 

So, Dawntreader drank from the nearby dew pools, and as they had dried by the morning sun, Proudfoot walked to the spring-fed stream over the ridge on which the glen lay. The pairing time drew near, and both Dawntreader and Proudfoot shed the velvet from their battle-ready crowns. Though each grew their fourth year tines, the bark Dawntreader had enjoyed all those months had given him a crown to match the saplings he loved, thick and strong.

On the day of the first pairing, Dawntreader arose early as usual, drinking from the pool and feasting on buds and berries, while Proudfoot slept in the glen, dreaming of the battles to come. At the first rays of warm sunlight, Dawntreader had already arrived at the pairing field, and Proudfoot, awakened by the sun, crested the hill to drink before the testing competitions of the day.  At the stream, however, as Proudfoot drank, he soon knew he would not win a battle, nor be paired with a strong doe, for Thomassi, the hunter, had followed Proudfoot to the stream and his swift arrow was quick to pierce Proudfoot’s side. Having watched through those many months, Thomassi knew Proudfoot drank daily from that stream and had been waiting until Proudfoot’s crown was ready and worthy of any hunter’s trophy room.

Far away in the glen, Dawntreader knew nothing of this, though he surely would learn when he returned with his doe to the protective shade that night.

_**Moral:**_ Those who rise early reap wisdom and treasure. Those who sleep late may in so doing seal their ill fate.
